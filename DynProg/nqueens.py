"""
The Nâ€“queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N Ã— N 
chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, the solution 
requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Solutions for the N-queens problem:

Boards to try:

4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 8x8
