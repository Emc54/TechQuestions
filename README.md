## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithm problems that I am solving as part of my preparation for coding interviews and competitive programming. Each solution is written in a clear and concise manner, with comments and explanations where necessary.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories loosely based on the type problem to solve. Each directory contains problems and their respective solutions.

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emc54/TechQuestions.git
```

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Here are the categories of problems you can find in this repository:

- **BinSearch**: Problems involving binary search as a solution.
- **Recursion**: Problems that can be solved by recursion.
- **TwoPointers**: Using two pointers to traverse lists/arrays.
- **SlidingWindow**: Extension of two pointers in a sliding window fashion.
